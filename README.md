# Discord selfbot
An old Discord selfbot.

## Setup
This is a NodeJS project. Create a file called `.env` in the root directory with the following parameters. Next to `USER_ID` should be a Discord user ID snowflake (to prevent the bot from responding to itself), and next to `TOKEN` should be an account token (for logging in).
```
USER_ID=
TOKEN=
```
